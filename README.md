# STAT 545A Participation Repository 

## Description

This GitHub repository is for all in-class activities done by **Stanley Nam** for **STAT 545A**. Through **STAT 545A**, students are expected to learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize data using R. You may want to check [the syllabus](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/) for more information.

You will find class activities by each week. This repository is organized so that each weeks participatory submissions can easily be found in each folder under the name of *week(s)\_x* (x being a number).

I have also provided links by topic as shown below. They will guide you to see the .r or .rmd files directly.
